<h2 class="title"><img src="question1.png">What is Tokyo Handsome Boys?</h2>

    <h2>N:</h2><p> Easy question. Handsome Boys is love. To show real Tokyo to my guest is my joyful, so I want to be Tokyo of you.</p><br>
	<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> Naoki is getting better at English. As Naoki says, Tokyo Handsome Boys loves our guests, and we love Tokyo, so naturally we started doing tours.<br></p>
<br>
<h2 class="title"><img src="question2.png">Why did you start Tokyo Handsome Boys?</h2>
<h2>N:</h2><p> I believe to meet local people during travel is the best way to get unbelievable experience. The thing that made me realize was my friend I made on my first trip to foreign country, Ram. I met him by accident on the street; after that he took me local place, he showed me local foods, local girls; we spent special time. Some day he said to me, “if Naoki didn’t meet me, you didn’t know anything in Vietnam, ha ha ha!”. I nod sincerely. After that, I have been to Vietnam four time with my friends to show them Ram. Every time Ram treat us very good, but on the fifth time he did not come. He had passed away. I realized too late that even with all the local place, local food, local girls, I did not love Vietnam. I loved Ram who showed me Vietnam. For me, Vietnam is Ram. So I decided to be Ram in Tokyo. </p><br>
<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> I guess that makes Naoki kind of like my Ram. Actually, when asked what their favorite part of Tokyo was, some of our guests have said “Tokyo Handsome Boys”! And that’s what really drives us; that kind of thing is what always makes us want to keep working at improving Tokyo Handsome Boys.</p><br>
<br>
<h2>N:</h2><p> Yeah! It is my proud. My guests’ smile is my Red Bull.<br></p>
<br>
<h2 class="title"><img src="question3.png">What is the Handsome Boys’ mission?</h2>
<h2 style="display:inline">N:</h2><p> I make you 100%, 120% satisfied. You can’t say Kyoto is number one after meeting Tokyo Handsome Boys. </p><br>
<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> It’s true, we are all about our guests – That’s why we base our tours around what our guests want to see, not around what we want to show. Too many tours think their value is in the information they give, and the sights they bring you to. Really the only thing that matters is the guests’ happiness.</p><br>
	<br>
<h2>N:</h2><p> I just remembered… My real mission is to take Keanu Reeves on a tour to Nakano’s “Nigi Nigi” sushi house.</p><br>
<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> And because a tour is made for the guests, no guest should ever feel restricted by a tour. Our tour is a power-up to your journey, giving you only what you really want to experience. More than tour guides, we are “adventure guides”, helping you to enjoy your short time in a totally new city to the fullest.<br></p>
<br>
<h2 class="title"><img src="question4.png">What sets you apart from other tour guides?</h2>

<h2>N:</h2><p> Youth, passion, and ambition. Of course handsome desu yo. Also, I become your Paparazzi!!!!<br>
<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> That is to say, to create perfect memories, we will take natural pictures of you – you don’t need to smile and say “cheese”, we will capture the moments that really matter. Plus, we will follow up after the tour, and keep in contact with you as friends even after you leave Japan.<br></p>
<br>
<h2 class="title"><img src="question5.png">What is the Handsome Boys’ dream?</h2>
<h2>N:</h2><p> I want to be representative of Tokyo. After we have succeeded as Tokyo Handsome Boys, I want to take a trip all over the world, and meet all my former guests again, to say the most important Japanese word, “Kanpai!!!!”<br></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>K:</h2><p> While I was in the US, Naoki first told me about his idea to continue Tokyo Handsome Boys as a career; it was a dangerous idea, for someone going to an elite school to forsake salaryman life and break off on their own. But I believed in him, so I came back to Japan to realize the dream. So, my only dream is that Naoki doesn’t have to give up and become a Japanese salaryman.<br></p>
<br>
<h2>N:</h2><p> ………………………….Y-y-yes. That.<br></p>
