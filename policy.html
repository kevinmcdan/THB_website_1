<h2>IF YOU'RE LATE FOR YOUR TOUR:</h2>

    <p>Tours will leave from the meeting place at the scheduled time. If you will be late for the tour, please contact Tokyo Handsome Boys as soon as possible through the site's contact form. When you have arrived at the meeting point, one of the tour guides will come to pick you up and take you to the current tour spot. If you miss the tour completely, unfortunately, we cannot offer you a refund.</p>

<h2>IF YOU NEED TO CANCEL:</h2>

    <p>If you are unable to participate in a tour, you must cancel by 3 days before the tour (so if the tour is on 5/24, for example, you must cancel by 5/21). If you cancel within 2 days before the tour, there is a 50% cancellation fee, so half of the tour cost will be refunded. If you cancel on the day of the tour, there will be a 100% cancellation fee. If you are unable to attend a tour and don't want to cancel, you are free to send a substitute to go on the tour in your place. There is no deadline for assigning a substitute, but please let us know sometime before the tour. Please note that we may not be able to accomodate that person's allergies and tastes if we are informed of them within 24 hours of the tour.</p>
    
    <h3 id="custom">CUSTOM TOUR CANCELLATION AND CHANGE POLICY</h3>
    
    <p>We will begin booking a custom tour as soon as the reservation comes in. As such, we must be strict about cancellation. Because it will take us at least five days to plan the tour, we must charge a 100% cancellation fee for all cancellations within five days before the tour (so if the tour is on 5/24, for example, you must cancel by 5/19). In addition, if you wish to change a destination for the custom tour, you must do so by three days prior to the tour. Because Custom Tours are charged on a group basis, we are still able to carry out the tour even with a decreased number of participants; however, if a member cannot attend, feel free to send a substitute in your place without an additional fee. However, we cannot guarantee that we can change a destination to accommodate that person's allergies and tastes if we are informed within three days of the tour.</p>

<h2>LIABILITY CLAUSE:</h2>

<p>The director and staff of Tokyo Handsome Boys, are released from, and specifically disclaim, all responsibilities for injuries or illness incurred traveling to and from tours, during tours, or resulting from food prepared at any restaurant included in the tour or otherwise eaten together with Tokyo Handsome Boys members. Tour fees do NOT INCLUDE food & beverage not specifically mentioned in the program description, or the cost of local transportation when not specifically mentioned. Participants in all programs are responsible for making arrangements for, and making payment for, their airfare, lodgings, and transportation to/from/within Japan. Participants are also responsible for obtaining and paying for any travel/trip/health insurance coverage they would like to have.</p>
